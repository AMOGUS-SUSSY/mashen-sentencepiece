Who are you talking to right now? Who is it that you think you see? Do you know how much I kill in a game? I mean, even if I tell you, you wouldn’t think im sus. Do you know what happens if I suddenly decide to stop sabotaging? A nuclear reactor big enough it could overshadow chernobyl goes belly-up. Gone. It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to so let me clue you in. I am not “a little sus”, Skylar. I AM THE IMPOSTER. A guy goes to med bay and gets stabbed while scanning, and you think that of me? No. I AM THE ONE WHO STABS.
FREAK. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO FREAK SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 69.69 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD FREAK WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOFREAKSTROM OF THOSE FREAKY MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE FREAK I FEEL AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂. 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓴𝔂.
