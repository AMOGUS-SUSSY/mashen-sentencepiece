Who are you talking to right now? Who is it that you think you see? Do you know how much I kill in a game? I mean, even if I tell you, you wouldn’t think im sus. Do you know what happens if I suddenly decide to stop sabotaging? A nuclear reactor big enough it could overshadow chernobyl goes belly-up. Gone. It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to so let me clue you in. I am not “a little sus”, Skylar. I AM THE IMPOSTER. A guy goes to med bay and gets stabbed while scanning, and you think that of me? No. I AM THE ONE WHO STABS.
